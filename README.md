# OrbitDetermination

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is part of the AEM 4301 course and focuses on designing an efficient transfer trajectory to Jupiter. The objective is to explore various mission design strategies, including planetary flybys, to minimize the required Delta V. The project takes inspiration from NASA's Juno and Europa Clipper missions, as well as ESA's JUICE mission.

## 🎯 Mission Objectives
- Establish a baseline using a **Hohmann transfer** to Jupiter.
- Design and analyze two alternative trajectories:
  - **Juno-like trajectory** with a **deep space maneuver (DSM).**
  - **Europa Clipper-like trajectory** with **planetary flybys but no DSM.**
- Evaluate and compare the efficiency of each trajectory in terms of **Delta V and mission duration.**

## 📌 Project Requirements
- The spacecraft starts from a **200 km low Earth orbit**.
- The mission must reach Jupiter in **less than 8 years**.
- Simulations must be implemented using **MATLAB**, including the following key functionalities:
  - `spacecraft.m`: Simulates the trajectory of the spacecraft from Earth to Jupiter.
  - `flyby.m`: Computes and plots hyperbolic flyby trajectories.
  - Calculation and verification of **Delta V maneuvers and vector diagrams**.

## 📑 Report Deliverables
### 1️⃣ Hohmann Transfer Analysis
- Theoretical calculation of **Delta V**.
- Departure hyperbola parameters.
- Approximate and refined **launch dates**.
- **Lead angle analysis**.

### 2️⃣ Alternative Trajectories
- Sequential list of **Delta V maneuvers and planetary flybys**.
- Detailed analysis of **flybys**, including hyperbolic trajectory parameters and plots.
- **Total Delta V comparison** with the Hohmann transfer baseline.
